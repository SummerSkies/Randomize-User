// Your task is to create a simple randomizing table view app(UIKit). The app needs to have the ability to enter any amount of users. After users have been entered be able to randomly select one user.
// The user only needs a name. A list of all users should display in a table view. It is up to you on how to get a random user from the group.

import XCTest
@testable import Randomize_User_List

final class Randomize_User_ListTests: XCTestCase {

    override func setUpWithError() throws {
    }

    override func tearDownWithError() throws {
    }

    func test_User_() throws {
        // This is an example of a functional test case.
        // Use XCTAssert and related functions to verify your tests produce the correct results.
        // Any test you write for XCTest can be annotated as throws and async.
        // Mark your test throws to produce an unexpected failure when your test encounters an uncaught error.
        // Mark your test async to allow awaiting for asynchronous code to complete. Check the results with assertions afterwards.
    }

    func testPerformanceExample() throws {
        // This is an example of a performance test case.
        self.measure {
            // Put the code you want to measure the time of here.
        }
    }
